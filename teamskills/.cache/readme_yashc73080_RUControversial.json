{"readme": "# RUControversial: Improving Trend Prediction\n\n## Overview\nRUControversial is a fine-tuned BERT model that helps predict how people will react to social media posts before they're published. Specifically, the model classifies content into categories similar to the r/AmITheAsshole subreddit verdicts: \"YTA\" (You're the A**hole), \"NTA\" (Not the A**hole), \"NAH\" (No A**holes Here), or \"ESH\" (Everyone Sucks Here).\n\n## Motivation\nSocial media users often can't predict how their posts will be received by others. RUControversial aims to help users gauge potential reactions to their content before posting, potentially helping them avoid negative backlash or controversy.\n\n## Dataset\nThe model was trained on the Iterative AITA Dataset compiled by Elle O'Brien, containing approximately 97,000 posts from r/AITA with associated verdicts. Due to computational constraints, we used a subset of 19,722 posts for our final model.\n\n## Models\n### Primary Model: BERT Classifier\n- **Architecture**: Fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-small (44M parameters)\n- **Features**:\n  - Disentangled attention mechanism\n  - Enhanced mask decoder\n  - Custom training strategy with frozen backbone for first epoch\n  - Focal Loss to address class imbalance\n  - Linear warmup and decay learning rate scheduler\n\n### Baseline Model: Logistic Regression\n- TF-IDF vectorized posts\n- SMOTE for handling class imbalance\n- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV\n\n## Results\n- BERT Model: 63.4% accuracy, 50.37% F1 score\n- Logistic Regression: 48.67% accuracy, 49% F1 score\n- The class imbalance in the dataset posed challenges, with the model struggling on minority classes despite mitigation techniques\n\n## Installation & Usage\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/yashc73080/RUControversial.git\ncd RUControversial\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Files\n- `bert_model.py`: BERT classifier implementation\n- `jobscript.sh`: Bash script to run a training job on the Amarel compute cluster  \n-"}

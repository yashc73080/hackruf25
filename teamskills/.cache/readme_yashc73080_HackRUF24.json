One day, our group members struggled to coordinate a beach trip that involved multiple stops. We realized how challenging it was to optimize our route and manage our time efficiently for multiple destinations. This sparked an idea: wouldn\u2019t it be great to have an itinerary planner that could streamline our travels and help us visit multiple places without too much trouble? So, the idea of TripWhiz was born.\n\n## What We Learned\nThrough this project, we learned valuable lessons about teamwork and the importance of user-centric design. We discovered how crucial it is to understand travelers' needs and preferences to create a truly useful application. Additionally, we gained hands-on experience with various technologies and programming languages, which broadened our skill set and enhanced our problem-solving abilities.\n\n## How We Built Our Project\nTo bring TripWhiz to life, we utilized the Google Cloud Platform and its APIs to enhance functionality. For the front end, we chose Next.js and React.js to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. We implemented Python with Flask on the backend, allowing us to handle data efficiently and serve user requests smoothly.\n\n## Challenges Faced\nOne of the major challenges we encountered was integrating various APIs while ensuring optimal performan"}
